            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>For this Biosite project, I will be sharing my friend Bryans's life. Bryan Ames is a 24-year-old Mexican-American who grew up in the Bay Area. He went to San Jose State University and studied criminal justice. His dream career is to become a police officer but in doing so he decided to improve his health and shape before applying for the bootcamp. He then picked up a hobby involving the gym. He pursued the gym because he always wanted to be physically strong. 
                He began this hobby when he was a Senior in High school. This was the turning point of his life because it was the best decision he had made that helped him get strong and healthy. His memorable experience when going to the gym is meeting people who share the same interests as him. This opens up many opportunities for him to make more connections. The Challenge he has faced in his journey is that he had hit a plateau in his strength and muscle due to lack of nutrition. He learned more about nutrition and began to make his meals. He doesnâ€™t need motivation because his hobby ended up being something he loves to do and even on the days he doesn't feel like going to the gym, he still goes because it's part of his daily routine. He hopes that with his work, people will never give up on pursuing their dreams and goals. His achievement that he is proud of at the gym was bench pressing 225lbs. For his future goals, he wants to bench press 315lbs. Besides going to the gym and being healthy he loves to eat junk food.
