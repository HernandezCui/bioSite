                <p>
                    Hello everyone, my name is Bryan Ames. I am 24 years old. I was born in Nebraska but moved to California at the age of 3. I grew up in the Bay Area, where all I ever wanted as a kid was to become a police officer. I have always had the need to help people and keep them safe. Hence, in order for me to become prepared, I decided to imrpove my health and fintess journey. It was my last year of high school when I decided to sign up for the gym. That first day I went I realized it was not a hobby but a lifestyle.</p>
                <p>
                    I went to San Jose State University to study crimial justice. This was the first stepping into my career. Not only did I prioritize school but I continue my gym routine. Attending the gym was the turning point of my life because it was the best decision I made that helped me get strong and healthy. Where my memorable experience when going to the gym is meeting people who share the same interests as me. This had opened up many opportunities to make more connections. The challenge I had faced in my journey of lifting was that I had hit a plateau in my strength and muscle due to lack of nutrition. Hence, I had gotten into meal prepping to better improve overall.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't need motivation to do the things I love to do because it has always been about my discipline and how my hobby ended up being something I love to do and even on my days off from the gym, I still want to go because it has been part of my daily routine. I hope that with my work, people will never give up on pursuing their dreams and goals. The achievement I am most proud of at the gym is bench pressing 225lbs. For my future goals, I want to be able to bench press 315lbs. Attending the gym has helped me by preparing for the Police Academy to be active. I hope that within the next year I will be accepted into the academy to start my career.
